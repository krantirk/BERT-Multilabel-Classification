Multilabel classification for Toxic comments challenge using Bert

!!!DEPRECATED!!!

Please check out my fast-bert repo for the latest implementation of multilabel classification. https://github.com/kaushaltrivedi/fast-bert

This repository contains the Jupyter notebook for multilabel text classification using BERT.  This is the accompanying code for the medium story https://medium.com/huggingface/multi-label-text-classification-using-bert-the-mighty-transformer-69714fa3fb3d.

Please refer to the import section to check out library dependencies.  This is an interim solution and in long term this will be merged with the amazing repo from HuggingFace https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT.
